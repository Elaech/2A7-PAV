# 2A7-PAV
This repository will be used by me (Minut Mihai Dimitrie) for writting lab work in order to be reviewed by the lab instructor.
In order to access the classes you need to go to the specific lab (Ex: lab5 -> PAV5) and from there : src/(compulsory/optional/bonus)
A readme file will be available for each lab.
Code contains doc comments.
